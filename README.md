# My Dotfiles
My personal dotfiles and configuration files for my development environment.

## üõçÔ∏è About my configuration
Here are some unique features of my configuration

- **üë®‚Äçüíª VSCode**: A fully declarative VS Code configuration. The final `settings.json` file is copied (not linked), allowing for quick on-the-fly tweaks. 

- **üíª Terminal**: A zsh shell Starship terminal with Nerd Font for a decorative and fast coding experience.

## Requirements
- Zsh
- Git
- curl (for installations)

Note: If you are on Windows, you must install WSL/Ubuntu (Linux Environment for Windows) and switch to the Zsh terminal to install my dotfiles.
